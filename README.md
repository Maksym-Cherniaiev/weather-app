## Weather application

In order application to run on your local server:

  ### `first`
    you should clone or download the program.

  #### `notice` - (if you downloaded zip-archive you should unzip it)

  ### `second`
    Inside "weather-app" folder run "install" file and wait till the end of the installation.

  ### `third`
    Inside "weather-app" folder run "run-app" file, the program should be opened automatically in your browser by port - http://localhost:3000/

    If you wish to stop the application, you should close the command-tool window.

  #### `notice` - (geocode-api, which I'm using for my app, uses http protocol, if you may have received a security message from your browser, please allow it to use unsafe scripts in order program to run correctly.)
